Today has been so much. Everything happening in the United States Capitol and Covid-19. I really do not know what to say about today. I was scared and still am. I hope that those who caused this a punished. I hate Trump and everyone else enabled him. I do not want all the republicans to wash there hands of what the fueled. Today the United States had the highest new cases Covid-19. I want Donald Trump impeached because of what happened today and what is still happening. I wish I could better write out what happened today and how I feel.
I still had classes today. I think I will like them but I had a hard time doing any work today with all that happened. I had the 3rd class in my physics sequence and intro to ethics. I need to get more notebooks for all my classes.
